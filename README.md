# B3264
A Base32 and Base64 decoder. This tool can be used to decode the encoded text in CTF events. An important quality this tool has is that it can decode multiple layers of the encoding.

For example : text -> Base64 -> Base32 -> Base32 -> Base64 -> encoded text

This tool will decode all the layers and give you final encoded text.
